# Koch *et al.* 2023 Code Repository
Code for simulation and figure plotting for "Loss or Gain of Function? Effects of Ion Channel Mutations on Neuronal Firing Depend on the Neuron Type" by Koch *et al.* 2023.
Modelling on the effects of ion current property changes on firing behaviour in diverse neuronal 
models and in with episodic ataxia type 1 associated _KCNA1_ mutations.


### Sections:
1. `./Code` Python code for simulations and analysis.
   - `./Code/run_simulations.sh` Bash shell script to run all simulations and analysis
   - `./Code/Functions` All functions for all neuronal models 
   - `./Code/Neuron_models` Scripts to run each neuronal models
   - `./Code/Sensitivity_Analysis` Scripts to run sensitivity analysis for each neuronal models
   - `./Code/KCNA1_mutations` Scripts to simulate all KCNA1 mutations in each neuronal models
   - `./Code/csv_generation` Scripts for additionaly analysis and to make .csv files needed for plottting

2. `./Figures` Figures and python files for generating them
   - `./Figures/Data` Data used to plot figures
